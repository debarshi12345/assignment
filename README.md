Here, data is given in the following format upto l = 10

| l | m |   g | h   |
| --| --| --  | --  |
| 1 | 0 | g10 | h10 |
| 1 | 1 | g11 | h11 |
| 2 | 0 | g20 | h20 |

| 3 | 1 | g31 | h31 |
| 3 | 2 | g32 | h32 |
| 3 | 3 | g33 | h33 |

up to l = 10


Your task is to write a code to plot Br at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) of the Earth.
The Earth has a radius of a = 6371 km, while the CMB radius is r = 2886 km. Use the Hammer
projection and apply coastline contours to create the visualization. Four sample figures have
been provided for you to evaluate the accuracy of your code.
Please send the code that only requires the following input files for plotting, along with the
four benchmark results.


Input file -1: data.mat

Input file -2: bluewhitered_range_adj_less_zero.m


Also colormap is given in the following link.
